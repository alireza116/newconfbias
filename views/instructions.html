        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Welcome! In this study you will be asked to make a series of judgments
        based on your belief about the strength of the relationship between two 
        variables.</p>

        <p>The relationship between two variables will be represented by a line, as 
        in the examples below. The angle of the line indicates the degree to which
        one variable increases or decreases as the other variable changes.</p>

        <p>For example, for two variables that have a perfectly <b>negative</b>
        relationship, each unit increase in X is associated with a unit <i>decrease</i> in Y.
        As a result, the line for a perfectly <b>negative</b> relationship would look like this:</p>

        <img class=img-centered src='/images/example_negative.png' height=240px>


        <p>For two variables that have a perfectly <b>positive</b> relationship, each unit
        increase in X is associated with a unit <i>increase</i> in Y. As a result, the line for
        a perfectly <b>positive</b> relationship would look like this:</p>

        <img class=img-centered src='/images/example_positive.png' height=240px>
        
        <p>If two variables are totally <b>unrelated</b> to each other, a unit increase in X is 
        associated with <i>no change</i> in Y. As a result, the line for the relationship
        between <b>unrelated</b> variables would look like this:</p>
        
        <img class=img-centered src='/images/example_flat.png' height=240px>
        

        <p>Let's take an example set of variables, X = height and Y = weight. Of 
        the three lines shown below, which one do you think best represents the 
        true relationship between height and weight?</p>

        <div id=choicearray>
        <img src='/images/hw_1.png' height=240px>
        <img src='/images/hw_2.png' height=240px>
        <img src='/images/hw_3.png' height=240px>
        </div>

        <p>Height and weight have a <b>moderately positive</b> relationship: For the most part, taller people 
        tend to weigh more. However, this relationship is not perfect, since there are many tall, skinny
        people who don't weigh that much, as well as many short people who weigh a lot. So unlike the 
        line shown to the left for a perfectly positive relationship, the line that best represents the true
        relationship between height and weight
        is closer to a horizontal line (the middle option in the row above).</p>

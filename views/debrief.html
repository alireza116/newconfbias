                        The purpose of this study is to develop new methods for eliciting beliefs about relationships between variables. For each set of variables you were asked to make judgments about the most likely relationship using a set of visualization methods. Your responses will be used to identify a method that can quickly and accurately measure a person’s subjective belief about such relationships. The findings of this study will improve our understanding of how people’s beliefs affect how they interact with and learn from data visualizations.
